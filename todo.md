- [ ] shaded sounds: since using common flex-displayed div per two sounds,
      idk how to show the impossible sound (gray-shaded cells).
      Probably is better to utilize the grid variant, since the `gap` doesn't
      go finely as it depends on the widths of the string with the letters. If
      the sound cell has no letter, it has 0 width, so the non-empty cell sinks
      towards the neighboring empty cell.
- [ ] add the dots in between the vowel pairs : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/IPA_chart_2020.svg
